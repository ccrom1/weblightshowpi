<?php
/* WebLightshowpi config file ;)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YOU MUST NOT HAVE THE LIGHTSHOWPI DIRECTORY IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY!
Place the directory in the top level of the file tree!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just fill out the info below to get started!
TIP: If you have your music in the lightshowpi directory and in folders by artists, dont use spaces to avoid possible problems.
In the line that says $homepage put the ip address of the pi. If you have the Weblightshowpi downloaded to somewhere other than /var/www/ then ask the google plus community.
In the line that says $lightshowpihome , put the *full* location of the lightshowpi directory in quotes!
Where the file says song1, song2, etc etc, put the name of the song in quotes. Capitals and spaces.
Where the file says location1, location2 etc etc, put the full location of the song in quotes. 
So example,
$lightshowpihome = "/lightshowpi"
$song1 = "Deck the halls";
$location1 = "/lights/music/sample/ovenrake_deck-the-halls.mp3";
